        Dear Fateema,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits.
<br>
<br>

I know things have been really rough lately. Things have been off, we’ve been fighting, we’ve been doing this, we’ve been doing that, blah blah blah. This letter is dedicated to you, and to make sure you know that I love you.

Fateema, my princess, my heart, my jaan, my everything. You mean the entire world to me. I’m just gonna say it to you directly, without having to go through 30 diff routes. You are my everything, my best friend, my ONLY friend, and someone whom I know I can trust and count on every single living moment. I know things have been really hard. I know that, and I haven’t been making things much better either. You’ve had college apps, arguments with me, family issues, they just stack up. Before we go any further, I am grateful to you for every single thing. From all the food you’ve gotten me this past year, to all the expensive gifts you give me without me having to ask twice, they all mean a lot. I wish I could do more, and give more back to you; times are just hard for me, and i'm sorry. I promise that once I’m set, you’ll get all the luxuries of this world. From all the makeup, to the dresses, whatever you lay your eyes on, I’ll get. With that being said, I love you, I just love you more than anything. This isn’t even about getting me gifts, you’ve helped me in so many other ways. From the countless nights you’ve stayed up helping me on my college essays/supplementals, to just being a morale support by my side, I will never forget your dedication towards me. For that, I will repeat this again, I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOU. 

Fateema, I am so so proud of how far you’ve came in life. I remember just last year you were stressing out over college, and NOW LOOK AT YOU GIRL. ACCEPTED TO 4 COLLEGES ALREADY??? Some of them being some of the best of the bset. You have such a bright future ahead, I can already feel it shining. Something I want you to keep in mind is to never look back, just keep it going, yeah? I love you

I love you so much princess, and if you haven’t been able to understand that by now, then I don’t knwo when you will. I love you more than anything, and I will continue to do so no matter what. I know I suck at expressing this to you, or even showing it to you, but deep down I love you. We just need to work a lot on our relationship, and I’m dedicated to being a better person for you princess. I love you fateema.

Love,
Mahmud Kalim
